    <h1>Bill Gates</h1>
    <p>
    Bill Gates is a businessman, investor and
      the richest man in the world. He founded 
      Microsoft, which is one of the largest
      software companies in the world, and he
      also founded the Bill and Melinda Gates
      Foundation. Bell was born in Seattle,
      Washington in 1955 and showed a keen
      interest in reading from an early age.
      His parents enrolled him in Lakeside 
      Private School, which introduces him in
      its classes for the first time to
      computers, to grow his passion for
      computers and software technology,
      and to begin with his friend Paul Allen
      to cultivate their talents in 
      programming. While in Lakeside classes,
      Bell managed to write a program in Basic
      that allowed computer users to play
      against a computer, and this was the
      first result of his passion for
      programming. He joined Harvard
      University and left after two years to
      establish Microsoft with his friend
      Allen. Bill pursued his work at
      Microsoft with enthusiasm, enthusiasm
      and powerful commercial insight, to
      become one of the largest software
      companies in the world
